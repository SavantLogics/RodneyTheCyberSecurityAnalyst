                    <h2><p> Here is a R project I worked on with my team in my class ADTA 5410 Applications and Deployment<br/>
                    <br />Cheers!</p></h2>

                    <p>Imagine you're organizing a big box of different toys. Some are action figures, some are puzzles, and others are board games. To make sense of it all, you need to put each toy in the right category. That's kind of what we do with our data in a project. We got a big list of information about products being sold, like their ID numbers, when they were sold, and their prices. But before we start figuring out what all this information tells us, we need to make sure everything is sorted right.</br>

                    </br><h3>How We Did It</h3></br>
                    Loading the Data: First, we put all our data into our computer using a special program called R. It's like opening the box of toys and laying them all out.</br>

                    </br>Sorting the Categories: Some of our data is like names (we call these 'categorical'). For example, each product has a special ID that's kind of like its name. We made sure these IDs are sorted like names, not like numbers you can add or subtract.</br>

                    </br>Fixing the Dates: Dates are special. We can't treat them like regular numbers or names. So, we fixed all the dates, like when each product was sold, to make sure they look like calendar dates.</br>

                    </br>Checking Numbers: We also have numbers in our data, like how many products were sold and their prices. We made sure these are all set up as numbers so we can do math with them later.</br>

                    </br>Taking a Peek: Finally, we took a quick look at our list to check if everything is sorted right. It's like checking each toy to make sure it's in the correct category.</br>

                    <p><h3>Why Checking for Missing Data Matters</h3></br>
                    </br>When we collect data, sometimes not every piece of information gets recorded. Imagine you're making a list of what everyone in your class ate for lunch, but some of your friends don't remember what they had. That's like having missing information in our data. It's important to know how much information is missing because it can affect how we understand and use the data later.</br>
                        
                    </br><h3>We Counted the Missing Pieces</h3></br>
                    </br>To find out what's missing in our data, we did a few steps:</br>
                        
                    </br>Creating a Special Function: We made a special tool (a function) in our program to look through each type of information (like product ID, sales date, price, etc.) and calculate how much is missing.</br>
                        
                    </br>Calculating Percentages: Our tool checks each type of information and figures out what percentage is missing. It's like figuring out what fraction of your friends didn't remember their lunch and turning it into a percentage.</br>
                        
                    </br>Making a List: Then, we made a list that shows each type of information with its missing percentage. The list has two columns: one for the type of information (like product ID) and one for the percentage of missing data.</br>
                        
                    </br>Sorting the List: We arranged our list so the information with the most missing data is at the top. If two types of information have the same amount missing, we put them in alphabetical order.</br>
                        
                    </br>Printing the List: Finally, we printed this list so we can easily see which parts of our data have the most and least missing information.</br></p>

                    </br><h3>Why Counting Competitors is Important</h3></br>
                    When a company sells products, it's important to know how many other companies are selling similar things. This is because having more competitors can affect how you price your products and how you plan your sales strategy.</br>

                    </br><h3>How We Counted the Competitors</h3></br>
                    </br>We added a new piece of information to our big list (the informs dataset) to keep track of competitors. Here's what we did:</br>

                    </br>Creating a New Column: We made a new space in our data called number_competitors. This is where we'll put the number of competitors for each product.</br>

                    </br>Counting Competitors: For each product, we looked at five different columns (comp_1_price to comp_5_price) that tell us the prices of similar products sold by other companies. We checked each of these columns to see if there's a price listed or not. Each price listed means there's a competitor.</br>

                    </br>Adding Up the Numbers: If a product has prices listed in three of these columns, it means it has three competitors. So, in the number_competitors column, we wrote the number 3 for that product.</br>

                    </br>Handling No Data: If there are no prices listed in any of the five columns for a product, it means there are no competitors. In this case, we wrote the number 0 in the number_competitors column.</br>

                    </br>Checking Our Work: After adding this new column, we checked to make sure our list still had the same number of rows (122,801) but one more column, making it 21 columns in total.</br>

                    <h3></br>What We're Doing and Why</h3></br>

                    </br>Knowing how our prices compare to others is key in business. It's like when you want to buy a snack and compare prices at different stores to see where it's cheaper or more expensive. We did something similar with our data. We added two new bits of information to each product in our big list:</br>

                    </br>Median Competitor Price (median_competitor_price):</br>

                    </br>This is the middle price when you line up all the competitor prices from lowest to highest.
                    Think of it like finding the middle number in a set of numbers. For example, if three stores sell the same snack for $1, $3, and $5, the median price is $3.</br>

                    </br>If we don't have any competitor prices for a product, we leave this as blank (or NA in our data).
                    Price Difference (price_differences):</br>

                    </br>Here, we calculate how different our price is from the median competitor price.
                    It's like saying, "Our snack is $1 cheaper than the middle price at other stores."
                    If we don’t know the competitor prices, we leave this blank too.</br>

                    </br>How We Did It</br>

                    </br>Calculating the Median Price:</br>

                    </br>We looked at up to five prices from different competitors for each product and found the median (middle) price.
                    This step involves lining up the prices and picking the one in the middle.
                    Finding the Price Differences:</br>

                    </br> We then figured out how much our price differs from this median competitor price.
                    This is just simple subtraction - our price minus the median price.
                    Handling Missing Data:</br>

                    </br>If we didn't have competitor prices for a product, we couldn't calculate these new numbers, so we marked them as NA (which means 'not available').</br>

                    </br>Checking the Data:</br>

                    </br> After adding these columns, our list still had the same number of products (122,801) but two more columns of information, making it 23 columns in total.</br>

                    </br><h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    </br><h4>Task 1</h4>
                    </br>By doing all this, we made sure our big list of information is neat and tidy. Now we're ready to start understanding what all this data about products being sold can tell us. It's a really important step to make sure we don't get confused later when we start the real detective work of figuring out the secrets in our data!</br>
                
                    </br><h4>Task 2</h4>
                    </br>By doing this, we now know exactly where our data is incomplete. This is like knowing which friends often forget their lunch, so we can plan better questions next time. Understanding what's missing helps us make better decisions about how to analyze our data later.</br>

                    </br><h4>Task 3</h4>    
                    </br>Now, our data not only tells us about sales and prices but also shows how many competitors each product has. This new piece of information will help us understand the competition for each product, which is really helpful for making good business decisions.</br>
                
                    </br><h4>Task 4</h4>
                    </br>Now, we have a better idea of how our prices stack up against the competition. This helps us understand if we're pricing our products too high, too low, or just right compared to other stores selling similar things.</br>

                    </br><h4>Task 5</h4>
                    Now, we have a clear picture of how much profit each product is making on average and how much competition it faces. This is really helpful for understanding which products are doing well and which ones are facing tough competition.</br>

                    </br><h4>Task 6</h4>
                </br>Our scatter plot showed us that, in general, having more competitors usually means less profit per product. But it's not the same for every product – some are different. Understanding this can help us make smarter decisions about where to focus our efforts in a competitive market.</br>

                    </br><h4>Task 7</h4>
                </br>By looking at these correlations, we get a better idea of how changing our prices might affect our profits and sales, especially when we have competitors. It's like figuring out if raising or lowering the price of your lemonade stand affects how much money you make and how many cups of lemonade you sell on a busy street.</br>

                    </br><h4>Task 8</h4>
                </br>By carefully tweaking prices, we think the company can increase profits without scaring off customers. It's all about making small adjustments and watching how customers respond, then finding that perfect price point where both the company and the customers are happy.</br>
